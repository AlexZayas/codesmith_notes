# Notes from Codesmith

These are my notes from Codesmith on any of the lectures that I found most challenging.

Fellow cohortmates are welcome to submit pull requests if they'd like to add `.md` files themselves to the `lectures` folder.

## To use

The lectures are all inside the lectures folder, just open those files in the browser and they should be readable.
