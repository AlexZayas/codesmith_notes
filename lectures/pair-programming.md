# Pair Programming

When pair programming with another person, one person guides (navigator) and the other writes the code (driver).

## How to do it?

### Research the problem

Talk about potential ideas for the problem.
Search around online, and look at documentation.
After you have a sense of a direction...

### Assign Driver + Navigator Roles

The navigator talks through the route:

- "Let's iterate through the array"

Driver takes the guidance and translates that into actual code

### Being a good navigator

Strong, clear technical communication
Avoid telling the driver what to write. _No syntax_ when it's not necessary.
Be precise, not exact—don't describe the code itself, but what it'll accomplish in plain english.
Avoid the temptation to navigate and drive at the same time.

### Being a good driver

Be a good listener!

## Why do we need to pair program?

- Helps you articulate your ideas more clearly
- Helps you to get started and not just research the problem
- Avoid obvious mistakes—like typos, and so forth.
- Practice for job interviews.
- Encounter new ways of solving problems

### What if I'm more/less experienced than my partner?

If you're more:

- You can practice playing the role of the senior engineer. Guiding less experienced engineers without ever actually giving them an answer
- You can get solidify your knowledge through teaching.

If you're less:

- Rapidly learn new concepts
- Learn how to ask the right questions
- Practice being firm with your partner when you don't understand something
